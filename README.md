# Greenspot DBM Project
### Overview
Greenspot Grocer, a fictional online grocery store, needed a scalable relational database to replace their unwieldy spreadsheet system. This project involved designing, implementing, and testing a MySQL database to organize their product data and support future expansion. 

### Objectives
1. Examine the current data and reorganize it into relational tables using the modeling tool in MySQL Workbench. 
2. Create and load the database with the sample data provided. 
3. Test and verify the database design by generating SQL JOIN queries. 

### Methodology
1. Data Exploration:
   Examined the sample data to identify fields that should be grouped into tables and determined logical relationships between them.

2. Database Design:
   Used MySQL Workbench's Modeling tool to create an ER diagram, defining tables, fields, primary keys, and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

3. Implementation:
   Generated SQL scripts to create the tables and populated them with the provided sample data.

4. Testing:
   Wrote SQL JOIN queries to validate the database design, demonstrating the ability to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query.
